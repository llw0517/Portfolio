                <p>Welcome to my portfolio website! My name is Oscar Lam, and I'm currently a student at the University of Waterloo, where I embarked on my journey in 2022. Pursuing a dual major in Financial Analysis and Risk Management, with a Statistics major and Computer Science minor on the horizon, I'm deeply passionate about blending numerical precision with technological innovation.</p>
                <p>Originally from vibrant Hong Kong, I spent my formative years at Munsang College before embarking on an exciting educational transition to Canada in 2021. At Milliken Mills High School, I continued to hone my academic prowess while immersing myself in a new cultural landscape.</p>
                <p>Beyond academia, I thrive in the realm of sports, finding joy and discipline in activities like volleyball, soccer, and basketball. These pursuits not only keep me physically active but also reinforce my commitment to teamwork and personal growth.</p>
                <p>Driven by a relentless pursuit of excellence, I embody qualities of self-motivation, collaboration, communication, and a meticulous attention to detail. These attributes form the bedrock of my approach to academic and professional endeavors, ensuring that I consistently strive for the highest standards of performance.</p>
                <p>Looking ahead, my short-term goals include maintaining a stellar GPA of 4.0 while diligently preparing for the CFA exam, a testament to my dedication to advancing in the field of finance. In the long term, spanning the next 5 to 10 years, I envision completing both the CFA and FRA exams, alongside earning a master's degree. Ultimately, I aim to carve a niche for myself in the realm of quantitative risk analysis, leveraging my diverse skill set to make meaningful contributions to the financial landscape.</p>
                <p>Join me on this journey of growth, exploration, and achievement as I pursue my aspirations with unwavering determination and a relentless pursuit of excellence.</p>
